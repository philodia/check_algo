Phrase Analysis algorithm function:

     Declare the variables:
         lengthPhrase <- 0
         numberWords <- 0
         numberVowels <- 0
         isLastCharacter <- False
        
     For each character in the sentence:
         sentenceLength <- sentenceLength + 1
        
         If character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y, lowercase or uppercase):
             numberVowels <- numberVowels + 1
            
         If character is a space OR character is the last character of the sentence:
             If character is a space:
                 isLastCharacter <- False
             Otherwise:
                 isLastCharacter <- True
            
             If isLastChar is True AND character is not a space:
                 numWords <- numWords + 1
    
     Display "Sentence contains ", numberWords, " word(s)."
     Display "The number of characters in the sentence is ", sentenceLength, "."
     Print "The number of vowels in the sentence is ", numberVowels, "."
